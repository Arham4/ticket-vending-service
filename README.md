# Arham Siddiqui's Walmart Assessment (Backend)

This is my attempt at the Walmart Assessment (Backend).

## Assumptions

- "Satisfaction" is defined as (in this order):
  - Prefer where seats requested can sit near each other
  - Prefer middle row
- "Safety" is defined as:
  - Must sit 3 seats apart from another person in same row.
  - If above cannot be satisfied, must sit 1 row apart from another person.
- "Availability" is defined as:
  - A booking has been completely processed for a respective seat.
  - There is no concept of "reserving" a seat without having purchased it.
